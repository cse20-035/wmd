          <p class="card-text">Gaborone main mall is the official centre of the city. Built in 1963 as preparation for the 1966 Botswana independence the main mall has generally maintained its look to date. Conservative voices have been numerous calling for controlled renovations that will not completely deface the old look and kill the spirit of the ‘old’ mall. Gaborone main mall is a place with shops, banks, business offices and an open walkway where shows, exhibitions and selling of crafts are conducted. The mall is flanked by the government enclave, especially the Botswana parliament to the west, and the civic centre and city council to the east.</p>

          <p class="card-text">This reserve was established in 1988 by the Kalahari Conservation Society to give the Gaborone public an opportunity to view Botswana’s wildlife in a natural and accessible location. It seems to be working: although the reserve is only 5 sq km, it’s the third busiest in the country and boasts wildebeest, elands, gemsboks, kudus, ostriches and warthogs. The birdlife, which includes kingfishers and hornbills, is particularly plentiful and easy to spot from observation areas.

The reserve also has a few picnic sites, a game hide and a small visitor-education centre.</p>
